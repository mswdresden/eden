s3menus.py:
	class S3MainMenu location and existance of main menu items (the upper menue)

	However, it is not a good idea to edit the official s3 code!
	There is the possibility, to redefine the functions placed there locally
	for your template => menus.py (see info there for more detail)
	
	BUT: the home button is deactivated in standard sahana-eden. So either
	     uncomment it - or better - paseNcopy the code there to your template's
		 menus.py and uncomment there

# DIV, URL, LI, HTML, ...
 methods like DIV, URL, LI, HTML are defined in gluon/html.py
 

# possible important directories (http://www.flossmanuals.net/sahana-eden/installation/): 

web2py/application/eden
	- static
		- controllers
		- languages
		- models
			- 000_config.py  <=== basic settings
							 <=== Any template setting can be over-ridden within 000_config.py for further fine-tuning as-required. 
		- modules
			- S3
			- S3db
		- private
			- templates
		- static
		- views
			- img
			- script
			- styles
			- themes
 'template' seems to have moved to modules (probably in order to have multipe
 templates, or just to have all templates in one place?)

# error-log in in .../web2py/mswFLR.log

# controllers and homepage
if nothing is done, the default homepage is taken /eden/controllers/default.py (index())
you somehow should give args ... then (probably) /modules/templates/<template>/controllers.py is used

# themes seem to be in static, hmm:
/eden/static/themes/DRK/homepage.css



# WTF is M and MM when a make a menue, what are the parameters
	- both are 'copies of classes' (shortcut)
	- both look alike but are different
		- MM is some layout (modules/s3layout.py) while M is a navigation item
		  (S3NavigationItem, modules/s3/s3navigation.py)
S3NavigationItem

###
homepage/new-page
you need:
 1. a function in your template's file controllers:
 def <name>:
 	# ... code ...
	return dict( .... ) # some kind of dict which the viewer can digest
	example: testmsw()
	
 2. eden/views/<name>/<name>.html
 	the view file testmsw.html	
	
 3. http://127.0.0.1:8000/eden/testmsw/testmsw
